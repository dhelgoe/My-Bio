# My-Bio

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

I started off my running through the nav bar and getting those links set up and to flex end one part and not the title. We then got the links to work on there corresponding section. We added photos to create the layout grid/column like layout with the first picture being 2 times the size of the others. I used them as background's instead of just an image so I could add a link and a header on the photo. Then I added the footer to create links on how to contact me. I also added links on the footer nav bar as well. I added media screens so the page would still look decent when sized down and not a mess.
